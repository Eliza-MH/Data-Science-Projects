# Data-Science-Projects
The first and second files contains a data sedmentation approach K-means and a hierarchical cluster analysis in R.
The dataset I used was developed by IBM data scientists and used to look at factors related to employee job satisfaction and attrition from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
I assumed I work in HR and was tasked with developing strategies to address the job satisfaction needs of the company’s employees. My business question was: “How can our company effectively target strategies to improve employee satisfaction to specific groups of employees based on their characteristics and performance?”
The third file, I conducted a multiple linear regression
